[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   "(G)" (gross) pauses include VM time: time to notify and block threads, do the pre-
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]         and post-safepoint housekeeping. Use -XX:+PrintSafepointStatistics to dissect.
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   "(N)" (net) pauses are the times spent in the actual GC code.
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   "a" is average time for each phase, look at levels to see if average makes sense.
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   "lvls" are quantiles: 0% (minimum), 25%, 50% (median), 75%, 100% (maximum).

[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   All times are wall-clock times, except per-root-class counters, that are sum over
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   all workers. Dividing the <total> over the root stage time estimates parallelism.

[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   Pacing delays are measured from entering the pacing code till exiting it. Therefore,
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   observed pacing delays may be higher than the threshold when paced thread spent more
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   time in the pacing code. It usually happens when thread is de-scheduled while paced,
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   OS takes longer to unblock the thread, or JVM experiences an STW pause.
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400] 
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   Higher delay would prevent application outpacing the GC, but it will hide the GC latencies
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   from the STW pause times. Pacing affects the individual threads, and so it would also be
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   invisible to the usual profiling tools, but would add up to end-to-end application latency.
[2020-10-26T14:52:27.770-0400]   Raise max pacing delay with care.
